# ML-Object-Detection
I am looking for help with a computer vision project. It is mostly available on a GitHub page, but I need some modifications and additions to meet my needs.  

The application is based on "Multiply" from GitHub. It currently works with sequences involving 2+ actors, but I need it to work with sequences involving a single actor as well as multiple actors.  

I would prefer the application to work with JPG sequences only. FFmpeg integration is not needed.  

The preprocessing stage must include the ability to export camera and SMPL-X data to FBX format and also to import camera and SMPL-X data from FBX. This is a must-have, as opposed to being limited to forced trace input → training.  

We can use the example data available on GitHub to start, and I can also provide data for single-actor sequences.  

For preprocessing, I want to integrate ViTPose and OpenPose to improve accuracy.  

FBX import and export should be the preferred method for handling camera and SMPL-X data. I will handle the custom SMPL-X Maya rig and cameras on my side. If the trace camera and SMPL-X data can be exported to me as FBX (from the preprocessing stage), I will set up my system to parse the data into the trainer.  

The goal is to ensure compatibility with my workflow, allowing seamless export/import of camera and SMPL-X data via FBX while enhancing the accuracy of preprocessing with ViTPose and OpenPose.

--------------
To help you with your computer vision project, the main goals are as follows:

    Modify the existing application to handle both single and multiple actors.
    Ensure compatibility with JPG sequences and avoid using FFmpeg.
    Integrate ViTPose and OpenPose for improved accuracy in the preprocessing stage.
    Enable the export and import of camera and SMPL-X data to and from the FBX format.

Given your requirements, I’ll break down the modifications and additions needed for your project. I'll also provide an example Python code to help with preprocessing and exporting/importing data in the desired format.
Key Modifications and Additions:

    Handling Single and Multiple Actors:
        You’ll need to modify the application to detect whether there is one actor or multiple actors in the sequence and process them accordingly. This can be done by checking for the number of detected actors in each frame and processing the poses accordingly.

    Support for JPG Sequences:
        Ensure the application is configured to process JPG image sequences instead of relying on FFmpeg. The images can be loaded directly using libraries like PIL or OpenCV.

    Integrating ViTPose and OpenPose:
        ViTPose (Vision Transformer Pose Estimation) and OpenPose are used to improve the accuracy of pose estimation. You can use these models to preprocess frames and extract SMPL-X data for each actor.

    Exporting and Importing FBX Format:
        To handle FBX data, use a Python library such as py-fbx or FBX SDK to read/write camera and SMPL-X data in FBX format.
        Ensure you can export the camera data and the SMPL-X body pose data into FBX, and handle their import from FBX files for use in the training pipeline.

Step-by-Step Approach to Implement Changes
Step 1: Modify the Application to Handle Single and Multiple Actors

You need to check how many actors are present in the sequence. Modify the actor detection logic to handle both single and multiple actors.

import cv2
import numpy as np

def process_frame(frame, actor_detector):
    # Detect actors in the frame
    actors = actor_detector.detect(frame)
    
    if len(actors) == 1:
        print("Single actor detected.")
        # Process single actor logic
        process_single_actor(frame, actors[0])
    else:
        print(f"{len(actors)} actors detected.")
        # Process multiple actors logic
        for actor in actors:
            process_multiple_actors(frame, actor)
            
def process_single_actor(frame, actor):
    # Extract pose for a single actor
    pass

def process_multiple_actors(frame, actors):
    # Extract poses for multiple actors
    pass

Step 2: Support for JPG Sequences

Modify the application to load and process images in JPG format instead of video files. Using OpenCV, you can easily load a sequence of JPG files.

import os
import cv2

def load_images_from_folder(folder_path):
    images = []
    for filename in sorted(os.listdir(folder_path)):
        if filename.endswith('.jpg'):
            img = cv2.imread(os.path.join(folder_path, filename))
            if img is not None:
                images.append(img)
    return images

# Example usage
folder_path = 'path/to/jpg/sequence'
images = load_images_from_folder(folder_path)

Step 3: Integrate ViTPose and OpenPose for Preprocessing

You can integrate OpenPose and ViTPose to extract poses for each actor. Below is an example of how to use OpenPose and ViTPose for extracting pose data.

For OpenPose, you can use the OpenPose Python API. For ViTPose, you can use the pre-trained ViTPose model from the vitpose library.

import vitpose  # Install ViTPose library
import openpose  # Install OpenPose Python bindings

# Initialize OpenPose and ViTPose models
openpose_model = openpose.OpenPose()
vitpose_model = vitpose.ViTPose()

def extract_poses(frame):
    # OpenPose Pose extraction
    openpose_poses = openpose_model.detect(frame)
    
    # ViTPose Pose extraction
    vitpose_poses = vitpose_model.detect(frame)
    
    # Combine both pose results (or use one depending on the accuracy needed)
    return openpose_poses, vitpose_poses

Step 4: Export and Import Camera and SMPL-X Data via FBX Format

For handling the export and import of data to and from FBX format, you will need to use a library that can handle FBX files, such as py-fbx or FBX SDK. Here's an example using the py-fbx library to read and write FBX files.

import pyfbx

# Export Camera and SMPL-X Data to FBX
def export_to_fbx(camera_data, smpl_x_data, output_fbx_path):
    scene = pyfbx.Scene()
    
    # Create a camera node
    camera_node = pyfbx.CameraNode(camera_data)
    scene.add_node(camera_node)
    
    # Create a skeleton node for SMPL-X data
    smpl_x_node = pyfbx.SkeletonNode(smpl_x_data)
    scene.add_node(smpl_x_node)
    
    # Save scene to FBX
    scene.save(output_fbx_path)

# Import Camera and SMPL-X Data from FBX
def import_from_fbx(fbx_file):
    scene = pyfbx.load(fbx_file)
    
    # Extract camera and SMPL-X data
    camera_data = scene.get_camera_data()
    smpl_x_data = scene.get_skeleton_data()
    
    return camera_data, smpl_x_data

# Example Usage
camera_data, smpl_x_data = import_from_fbx("path_to_fbx_file.fbx")
export_to_fbx(camera_data, smpl_x_data, "output_path.fbx")

Preprocessing with ViTPose and OpenPose

You can integrate ViTPose and OpenPose into the preprocessing stage to enhance pose extraction accuracy. Use the pose data to generate SMPL-X skeleton poses and export them into FBX format.

import vitpose
import openpose

def preprocess_frame(frame):
    # Using OpenPose or ViTPose for pose detection
    openpose_model = openpose.OpenPose()
    vitpose_model = vitpose.ViTPose()

    openpose_poses = openpose_model.detect(frame)
    vitpose_poses = vitpose_model.detect(frame)
    
    # Choose the best pose (or combine the results)
    best_poses = combine_pose_data(openpose_poses, vitpose_poses)
    
    # Export pose and camera data to FBX
    camera_data = extract_camera_data(frame)
    smpl_x_data = extract_smpl_x_data(best_poses)
    export_to_fbx(camera_data, smpl_x_data, "frame_data.fbx")

def combine_pose_data(openpose_poses, vitpose_poses):
    # Implement logic to combine or choose the best pose
    return openpose_poses if len(openpose_poses) > len(vitpose_poses) else vitpose_poses

def extract_camera_data(frame):
    # Logic to extract camera data (such as rotation, position)
    return camera_data

def extract_smpl_x_data(poses):
    # Logic to convert poses into SMPL-X data
    return smpl_x_data

Final Workflow:

    Preprocessing:
        Load JPG image sequences.
        Extract poses using OpenPose or ViTPose.
        Generate SMPL-X skeleton data for each frame.
        Export camera and SMPL-X data to FBX format.

    Training:
        Parse the SMPL-X and camera data from FBX files.
        Use the data in the training pipeline as needed.

    Integration:
        Ensure that your system can import the processed FBX files and integrate them with your custom SMPL-X Maya rig and cameras.

Conclusion

With the above code snippets and workflow, you can modify the "Multiply" GitHub project to support single and multiple actors, work with JPG sequences, integrate ViTPose and OpenPose, and export/import data in the FBX format. This approach will allow you to integrate the project with your existing system and improve accuracy during preprocessing, ensuring compatibility with your workflow.
